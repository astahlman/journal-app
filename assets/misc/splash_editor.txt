<*Welcome to DearQwerty*>

<*Crash Course*>
	Everything you write in DearQwerty is inside an entry. Entries can have plain text and tags. Tags can be nested inside each other and plain-text can (but doesn't have to) be inside a tag. Sound complicated? It's really not. Tags just divide your entry into logical sections, making it easier to view and search for entries later. You don't even have to use them if you don't want to, but you would be missing out.
	<*Tags*>
		This is how you open a tag:
			##ignore##<*My First Tag*>##endignore##
		And here's how you close it:
			##ignore##<*/My First Tag*>##endignore##
		Once you open a tag, the editor will automatically close it for you.

	<*Parser*>
