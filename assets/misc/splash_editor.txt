<*Introduction*>
	This is inside the Introduction tag. Tags give us a way of grouping things logically, enabling easier searching and viewing. See that little icon in the top left? That minimizes the tag. Theoretically you could use this app to save your notes without ever using tags, but you would really be missing out.
	<*SideNote*>
		By the way, it's possible to nest tags. See? In fact, you probably will unless you're just jotting down something really simple.
	<*/SideNote*>
	P.S. Tags are all one word, and don't get crazy with the symbols.

	<*Templates*>
		Sometimes you've got the skeleton of an outline that you use over and over.
		<*ShamelessSelfPromotion*>
			If you register, you'll be able to define templates as you type that you can reuse next time.
		<*/ShamelessSelfPromotion*>
		Syntax is:
		##ignore##
		##def MyTemplate##
			<*SavedForLater*>
				All of this will get saved
			<*/SavedForLater*>
			Useful, huh?
		##enddef MyTemplate##
		##endignore##
		Later, when we want to insert our template into the editor, we just type "##insert MyTemplate##" and it will be automatically added for us.
	<*/Templates*>
	<*Searching*>
		<*ShamelessSelfPromotion*>
			If you register, you'll be able to search by any combination of tag, keyword, and date range.
		<*/ShamelessSelfPromotion*>
		All of your entries are accessible through the search. Want to see everything you've put on your ##ignore## <*TODO*> ##endignore## list lately? Search on the #TODO tag for dates after one week ago and you can view a nice list of all the things you've been putting off.
	<*/Searching*>
	<*Parser*>
		By now you may have noticed the ##ignore## ##ignore## ##endignore## macro we've been using. If you haven't figured it out, that's how you escape stuff from being interpreted as it normally would be by the parser. Your entry is parsed in real time, and if you do something illegal, the editor will let you know about it in the error table below. You can still save entries with parse errors, but only the plain-text will get saved and you won't be able to search on tags. (Don't worry, you can always go back and edit your entry to fix the errors later.)
		<*NerdsOnly*>
			If you know any basic HTML, you can include that in your entries, too. It will be displayed in the viewer as you expect. Some useful tags include:
				<ul>
					<li>&lt;a href="link_path"&gt; Includes links</li>
					<li>&lt;img src="image_path"&gt; To insert an image (Make sure it's small enough to render inside the view area) <a href="http://imgur.com/LeB2A"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LeB2A.jpg" alt="" title="Hosted by imgur.com" /></a></li>
					<li>&lt;b&gt;For <b>bold</b> text</li>
					<li>And of course, &lt;ul&gt; (see?) and &lt;li&gt;</li>
				</ul>

Those are the highlights. Now delete this and give it a whirl. You'll be able to preview your entry live on the right.
