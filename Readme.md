<a href="http://dearqwerty.herokuapp.com/">DearQwerty</a> is a hacker's journal web app. Users write entries using a simple, custom markup language which gets parsed in real-time. Entries are logically subdivided into tagged nodes to enable better searching and viewing. 

DearQwerty is now <a href="http://dearqwerty.herokuapp.com/">live on Heroku.</a> The project represents my endeavor to learn Javascript. The backend is implemented (very messily) in Django. If anyone is interested in contributing, pull requests are more than welcome.
